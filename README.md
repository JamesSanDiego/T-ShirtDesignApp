# T-ShirtDesignApp
SYST24444 Sheridan College Assignment 3 

This project allows the user to enter in a city, if the user enters anything else other than "Oakville" then the "t-shirt" design will change. The user will be able to select the t-shirt size, which will dynamically change the t-shirt size under the "Finished Design" header.

DOM manipulation was used for click events.

This project demonstrates my understanding of Angular components and sharing directives.
